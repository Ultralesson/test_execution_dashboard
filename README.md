# Test Results Dashboard with Streamlit

This is an example application built with Streamlit to demonstrate how to create a simple test results dashboard. The application reads data from a JSON file and visualizes it using interactive charts and filters.

## Requirements
* Python 3.6 or later
* Streamlit 0.87.0 or later

## Usage

To run the application, clone this repository and navigate to the project directory. Then, install the required packages by running:


```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Next, run the following command to start the Streamlit application:

```streamlit run test_execution_dashboard.py```

This will open the application in your default web browser. From there, you can interact with the filters and charts to explore the test results data.

## Data
The test results data is stored in the test_results.json file in the root directory of the project. This file can be replaced with your own data in the same format to visualize your own test results.
